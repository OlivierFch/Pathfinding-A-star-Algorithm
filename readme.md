# Path finding visualization tool
 
This repository is dedicated to my personal project to learn DSA. The aim of this project is to apply the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two points using pygame library in Python.

## Commands
`Left click` : Place start, end, and barrier points on the grid  
`Right click` : Delete the selected points  
`Space bar` : Run the code and draw the shortest path  
`C` : Clear the grid
